The great idea starts from the small. Some projects by applying data science, machine learning to various industry data, with Big Data platform. It is partially the requirement of "Big Data Techniques and Technologies" module in 2016/2017, conducted to Business Analytics and Master in Business Analytics students, from National University of Singapore. 

**Project #1 - Terrorisks**
 - Problem: build models to accurately predict the next terrorist attack after the first attack so that reinforcements can be sent to prevent even more casualties, or whether these same resources should be channeled to a rescue mission instead to help those involved in the first attack. 
 - Dataset: approximately 156,000 terrorist attack instances that took place from 1970 to 2015, https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd 
 - Model: Regression, Random forest, Market basket analysis

**Project #2 - The Airbnb Scoop**
 - Problem: to help Airbnb hosts determine factors which will affect their earnings and popularity, by looking at Airbnb listing data and individual guest reviews (not an average rating), understanding the amenities and location of listings that guests prefer.
 - Dataset: 17,369 listings in Barcelona with 95 features describing each listing; 388,184 reviews with 6 features, we translated non-English using a Python package called TextBlob; a list of 579 top attractions in Barcelona, their ratings, latitude and longitude from TripAdvisor.
 - Model: Regression, Classification with decision tree, Sentiment analysis
